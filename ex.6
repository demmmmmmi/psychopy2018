# 1. Go through this program and write a comment above each line explaining it.
# 2. Find all the places where a string is put inside a string. There are four places.   4.9.10.15
# 3. Are you sure there are only four places? How do you know? Maybe I like lying.  I'm not sure if it is correct.      
# 4. Explain why adding the two strings w and e with + makes a longer string.      因為w跟e都是字串所以可以用+，如果不同屬性可能會出現錯誤
